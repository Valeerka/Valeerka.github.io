        <h1 style="color: #172333;">Hi, I'm Valeria Cantsheva – Welcome to My ICT Journey</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;">I’ve always had a close connection with computers, growing up I was surrounded by 
            technology from a young age. At times, my fascination with them almost became an 
            addiction. I remember seeing programming and hacking in movies and thinking it was the 
            coolest thing ever. The idea of understanding how computers really work stayed with me 
            for years, even though I didn’t pursue it right away. It wasn’t until I met someone who 
            aspired to be a white hat hacker that my interest was reignited. Their passion for 
            ethical hacking sparked something in me, and I realized this field could offer more 
            than just entertainment, it could be a career.</p>
            <h1 style="color: #172333;"> <br>Motivation</h1>
            <p style="text-align: center;">While my love for computers played a huge role in my decision to join the HBO-ICT program, 
                I can’t ignore the practical side of things. Growing up, money was always tight at home. 
                My mom worked hard to support both of us, and I knew I wanted a stable career that could 
                provide financial security. When I learned that the ICT field offers many well-paying 
                opportunities, I saw it as the perfect combination: a way to work with something I love
                while also achieving stability in life. It felt like a more exciting and natural choice 
                for me compared to other fields like law or business.</p>

        <h1 style="color: #172333">Future Exploration</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Although I’m only just starting the program, 
            I’m excited to explore the different paths ICT has to offer. I haven’t 
            fully decided what I want to specialize in yet, but here are a few areas 
            that interest me:
            <li>White hat hacking: Protecting systems and learning the skills to defend against cyberattacks.</li>
            <li>Programming: Developing different kinds of software, whether it's games, apps, or websites.</li>
            <li>Creative projects: I like the idea of combining technology with creativity to build something unique.</li>

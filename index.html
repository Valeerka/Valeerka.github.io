        <h1>Hi, I'm Valeria Cantsheva – Welcome to My ICT Journey</h1>
        <p>I’ve always had a close connection with computers, growing up I was surrounded by technology.
            At some point, my fascination with them almost became an obsession. I remember seeing
            programming and hacking in movies and thinking it was the coolest thing ever. Ofcourse
            now that I’m old enough I’ve realized that its not like the movies, but it still seemed
            quite interesting to me. The idea of understanding how computers really work stayed with
            me for years, even though I didn’t pursue it right away. It wasn’t until I met someone
            who aspired to be a white hat hacker that my interest was peaked. Their passion for ethical
            hacking sparked something in me, and I realized this field could offer more than just
            entertainment, it could be a career.</p>

        <h1><br>Motivation</h1>
        <p>While my love for computers played a huge role in my decision to join the HBO-ICT program,
            I can’t ignore the practical side of things. Growing up, money was always tight at home.
            My mom worked hard to support both of us, and I knew I wanted a stable career that could
            provide financial security. When I learned that the ICT field offers many well-paying
            opportunities, I saw it as the perfect combination: a way to work with something I love
            while also achieving stability in life. It felt like a more exciting and natural choice
            for me compared to other fields like law or business.</p>

        <h1>Future Exploration</h1>
        <p>Although I’m only just starting the program,
            I’m excited to explore the different paths ICT has to offer. I haven’t
            fully decided what I want to specialize in yet, but here are a few areas
            that interest me:
            <li>White hat hacking: Protecting systems and learning the skills to defend against cyberattacks.</li>
            <li>Programming: Developing different kinds of software, whether it's games, apps, or websites.</li>
            <li>Creative projects: I like the idea of combining technology with creativity to build something unique.
            </li>

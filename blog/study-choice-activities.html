                <p>Reasoning for choosing HZ: <br>
                    The reasoning for choosing HZ was straightforward for me. I've always been fascinated
                    by computers and technology, so pursuing a study that's focused entirely on that felt
                    like a natural choice. HZ stood out because I know some friends who either studied
                    or still study at HZ and really recommended the school. I knew it would be the right
                    place for me to explore more about ICT while also gaining the practical skills I need
                    for a successful career. <br><br>


                    Motivate your study: <br>
                    My passion for computers and technology started early, and the HBO-ICT program at HZ gives
                    me the chance to build practical skills. I’m excited to explore my interests in ethical hacking,
                    programming & designing while working toward a stable and fulfilling career.
                    I don't have any programming skills as of this moment, so I want to work on that and I also
                    want to improve my presentation skills. I tend to be quite shy at times and hope that my time
                    at HZ will provide me with the opportunity to overcome my shyness. <br><br>

                    Expectations after studies:<br>
                    I would love to pursue a Master's in tech abroad after completing the program. I'm not
                    sure what I want to do career-wise, it's something I still have to figure out.

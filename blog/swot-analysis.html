                <p>Strengths: I’m creative, pay attention to detail and am eager to learn
                    Weaknessess: I have trouble with time management, presenting and I don't have any programming
                    skills.
                    Opportunities: Networking with students from all over to work on my public speaking. 
                    Seek help from professionals and attend workshops to work on my presenting and programming skills.
                    Work on projects that require creative problem-solving to showcase that strength.
                    Threats: Struggling with time management could lead to missing deadlines.
                    Lacking programming skills could make it more challenging for me.
                    Difficulty presenting could potentially affect projects.
